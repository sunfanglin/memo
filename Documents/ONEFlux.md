## Process
- You have flux data and are going to gapfill using ERA data, you need to run oneflux first to generate 02_qc_auto files, which are necessary for downscalling of ERA data. 
- The pipeline will stop cause no ERA data yet, but the 02_qc_auto will appear.
- Run downscaling to get 06_meteo_era files.
- Run oneflux pipeling again.
