### 1. Introduction

The Himalayan region, characterized by its extreme topography, complex orographic features, and dynamic weather patterns, presents significant challenges for accurate meteorological modeling and forecasting. The mid-Himalayas, encompassing areas near Mount Everest (also known as Sagarmatha or Chomolungma), experience pronounced seasonal variations driven by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) in the summer months and westerly disturbances in winter. During the monsoon period, intense precipitation events, often leading to flash floods, landslides, and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), pose substantial risks to local communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. A notable example occurred during July 2-6, 2024, when torrential rainfall associated with the active monsoon phase affected the eastern Nepal Himalayas, including regions around Mount Everest in the Solukhumbu district. This event contributed to widespread flooding across Nepal, highlighting the need for reliable high-resolution simulations to capture such localized extreme weather phenomena.

Reanalysis datasets serve as critical inputs for mesoscale models like the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, providing initial and lateral boundary conditions essential for downscaling global atmospheric states to regional scales. These datasets integrate observations, satellite data, and model outputs through data assimilation techniques to produce consistent gridded fields of meteorological variables. In mountainous terrains like the Himalayas, where observational networks are sparse due to inaccessibility and harsh conditions, the choice of reanalysis data can profoundly influence simulation accuracy, particularly for variables sensitive to topography such as precipitation and wind.

This study compares two prominent reanalysis products: the Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Analysis (IMDAA) and the ECMWF ReAnalysis 5 (ERA5). IMDAA, developed collaboratively by the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), India Meteorological Department (IMD), and the UK Met Office, offers a regional focus on the Indian subcontinent with a horizontal resolution of approximately 12 km and 63 vertical levels. It assimilates a dense network of Indian observations, including radar and rain gauge data, making it particularly suited for monsoon-related processes and orographic effects in South Asia. In contrast, ERA5, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), is a global reanalysis with a coarser horizontal resolution of about 31 km and 137 vertical levels, incorporating advanced four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) for enhanced temporal consistency. While ERA5 excels in global applications, it may exhibit biases in high-altitude regions due to less localized assimilation of Himalayan-specific data.

Evaluations of the IMDAA dataset, as detailed in its foundational study, have demonstrated its strong performance in capturing monsoon precipitation and extreme events over India, with reasonable representation of climatological features, inter-annual variability, and intra-seasonal oscillations during the summer monsoon season. Key results include close verification against IMD observations and ERA5, with IMDAA effectively representing salient summer monsoon features such as the low-level jet (LLJ) and tropical easterly jet (TEJ), though showing a slightly weaker LLJ and TEJ compared to ERA5. IMDAA captures the mean, interannual, and intraseasonal variability of summer monsoon rainfall fairly well, but produces more rainfall during southwest and northeast monsoons than observations and ERA5. It also generates a slightly cooler winter and hotter summer than observations, with the reverse pattern in ERA5, which matches maximum and minimum temperatures better. A case study of the 2018 Kerala floods highlighted IMDAA's ability to capture finer features of extreme rainfall over complex terrain like the Western Ghats, underscoring its benefits for high-resolution applications, though verification is limited by the lack of comparable-resolution observations. For instance, comprehensive assessments against gridded observations and other reanalyses like ERA5 highlight IMDAA's superior skill in detecting cloudburst events over the Northwest Himalayas, with lower biases in precipitation intensity and better spatial correlations. However, while IMDAA outperforms in regional monsoon dynamics, it may still underestimate extremes in certain sub-regions, underscoring the need for event-specific validations.

Similar works have compared the performance of reanalysis datasets in driving high-resolution WRF simulations over the Himalayas. For example, systematic evaluations of WRF downscaling using datasets like ERA5 and HARv2 reveal improvements in simulating precipitation and temperature in complex terrains like the Nepalese Himalayas, though biases persist in high-elevation snowfall and cold extremes. Other studies assessing multiple reanalyses (e.g., ERA-Interim, ERA5, IMDAA) in WRF setups for the Western and Central Himalayas show that higher-resolution regional products like IMDAA reduce spatial biases in winter precipitation and cloudbursts compared to global ones, enhancing hydro-climatic impact predictions. These comparisons emphasize the advantages of regionally tuned reanalyses in capturing orographic effects, but highlight ongoing challenges with resolution and data assimilation in extreme events. In a related study, Reshma et al. (2019) evaluated the WRF model's performance in simulating intense rainfall events over the Eastern Himalayan region using ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Their key conclusions include that the WRF model, configured with optimized parameterization schemes (e.g., Thompson microphysics and Kain-Fritsch cumulus), reasonably captured the spatial patterns and timing of heavy rainfall, but tended to overestimate precipitation amounts in orographic areas due to inadequate representation of sub-grid processes. The study emphasized the need for high-resolution topography and ensemble approaches to improve accuracy in forecasting extreme events in the region.

The rationale for this comparison stems from prior research indicating IMDAA's superior performance in capturing monsoon precipitation over the Indian Himalayas compared to global reanalyses, attributed to its higher resolution and regional observational integration. However, few studies have evaluated these datasets in high-resolution WRF simulations for short-term extreme events in the mid-Himalayas near Mount Everest, where elevations exceed 8,000 m and microclimatic variations are pronounced. This gap is critical, as accurate modeling in such areas supports disaster risk reduction, hydrological forecasting, and climate impact assessments.

The primary objectives of this study are to: (1) configure and run a high-resolution WRF model driven by IMDAA and ERA5 for the precipitation event of July 2-6, 2024, near Mount Everest; (2) evaluate the simulations against available observational data, focusing on key meteorological variables; and (3) identify the strengths and limitations of each reanalysis dataset in representing complex terrain dynamics. By examining this specific monsoon rainfall episode, the study aims to provide insights into optimal data choices for operational forecasting in the Himalayas.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the study area, datasets, and observational sources; Section 3 outlines the WRF model setup and evaluation methodology; Section 4 presents the results; Section 5 discusses implications and limitations; and Section 6 concludes with recommendations and future directions.
