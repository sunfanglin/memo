Title: Evaluating the Performance of IMDAA versus ERA5 Reanalysis Data in Driving a High-Resolution WRF Model over the Mid-Himalayas

### Abstract
- Provide a concise summary of the study objectives, methodology, key findings, and implications.
- Highlight the comparative performance of IMDAA and ERA5 in simulating meteorological variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature, wind) in complex mountainous terrain.
- Mention the study period, resolution, and validation against observations.

### 1. Introduction
- 1.1 Background on regional climate modeling in mountainous regions, focusing on challenges in the Himalayas (e.g., orographic effects, monsoon dynamics, extreme weather events like cloudbursts).
- 1.2 Importance of reanalysis datasets as initial and boundary conditions for mesoscale models like WRF.
- 1.3 Overview of IMDAA (Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Analysis) and ERA5 (ECMWF ReAnalysis 5): Key features, resolutions (IMDAA: ~12 km horizontal, ERA5: ~31 km), data assimilation methods, and regional applicability.
- 1.4 Rationale for comparison: Previous studies showing IMDAA's advantages in Indian monsoon regions and Himalayas (e.g., better representation of orographic precipitation) versus ERA5's global consistency.
- 1.5 Study objectives: Assess performance in high-resolution WRF simulations for mid-Himalayas (define region, e.g., central Himalayas including parts of Nepal, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh); evaluate metrics for accuracy in precipitation, temperature, and other variables; identify strengths/limitations.
- 1.6 Structure of the paper.

### 2. Study Area and Data
- 2.1 Description of the mid-Himalayas: Geography, elevation ranges (e.g., 2,000–6,000 m), climate characteristics (monsoon-dominated summers, westerlies in winter), and relevance for hydrological and disaster studies.
- 2.2 Reanalysis Datasets:
  - 2.2.1 IMDAA: Details on development (collaboration between NCMRWF, IMD, UK Met Office), temporal coverage, variables used (surface and upper-air fields), strengths in assimilating Indian observations.
  - 2.2.2 ERA5: Global reanalysis from ECMWF, hourly data, improvements over ERA-Interim, but potential biases in high-altitude regions.
- 2.3 Observational Data for Validation:
  - Ground-based: Rain gauges, AWS from IMD, snow depth measurements.
  - Satellite/remote sensing: IMERG/GPM for precipitation, MODIS for snow cover, radiosonde data for upper-air validation.
  - Other: High-altitude observatories or field campaign data if available.

### 3. Methodology
- 3.1 WRF Model Configuration:
  - Version (e.g., WRF-ARW v4.x), nested domains (e.g., outer: 27 km, middle: 9 km, inner: 3 km or 1 km for high resolution), vertical levels (e.g., 50 eta levels).
  - Physics schemes: Microphysics (e.g., Thompson), cumulus parameterization (e.g., Kain-Fritsch for outer domains, none for inner), PBL (e.g., YSU), land surface (e.g., Noah-MP with high-res topography).
  - Topography and land use: Use of high-resolution datasets (e.g., SRTM 30m DEM, MODIS land cover).
- 3.2 Simulation Setup:
  - Periods: Select representative events/seasons (e.g., monsoon 2020–2024, winter precipitation episodes, cloudburst cases).
  - Experiments: Two parallel runs – one driven by IMDAA, one by ERA5 (as initial and lateral boundary conditions).
  - Spin-up time, output frequency.
- 3.3 Evaluation Metrics:
  - Statistical: Bias, RMSE, MAE, Pearson correlation, for variables like precipitation (daily/accumulated), 2m temperature, 10m wind speed, snowfall.
  - Categorical: POD, FAR, CSI for extreme events (e.g., heavy rainfall thresholds).
  - Spatial: Pattern correlation, Taylor diagrams.
  - Vertical profiles: Comparison of soundings for temperature, humidity, wind.

### 4. Results
- 4.1 Overall Performance Comparison:
  - Spatial distribution of simulated precipitation/temperature versus observations.
  - Time series analysis for key stations or sub-regions.
- 4.2 Precipitation Analysis:
  - Monsoon season: IMDAA vs ERA5 in capturing orographic enhancement; potential underestimation in both but IMDAA's better correlation (e.g., based on similar studies).
  - Winter snowfall: Differences in accumulation over glaciers/high altitudes.
- 4.3 Temperature and Wind:
  - Bias in near-surface temperature; lapse rate accuracy in complex terrain.
  - Wind patterns: Valley breezes, jet streams.
- 4.4 Extreme Events:
  - Case studies (e.g., cloudbursts in Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand): Event-specific validation.
- Use figures/tables: Maps, box plots, scatter plots for metrics.

### 5. Discussion
- 5.1 Reasons for Performance Differences: IMDAA's regional assimilation of dense Indian observations vs ERA5's global scale; resolution impacts on topography representation.
- 5.2 Limitations: Data sparsity in high altitudes, WRF parameterization sensitivities, computational demands of high-res runs.
- 5.3 Implications: For forecasting in Himalayas (e.g., flood/avalanche prediction), hydrological modeling, climate change studies.
- 5.4 Comparison with Prior Studies: Reference findings from Western/Eastern Himalayas showing IMDAA superiority in precipitation.

### 6. Conclusions
- Summarize key findings: e.g., IMDAA generally outperforms ERA5 in precipitation accuracy due to better regional representation.
- Recommendations: Use IMDAA for Himalayan simulations; suggest hybrid approaches or further refinements.
- Future Work: Ensemble simulations, longer periods, incorporation of additional datasets (e.g., NGFS).
