## Satellite remote sensing 

1. One limitation of estimating surface fluxes using only in-situ observation data is that it may not capture the spatial variability of surface variables over a large and heterogeneous landscape. In-situ observations are point-specific and may not represent the entire region accurately. Additionally, the availability of in-situ data may be limited, especially in remote or inaccessible areas like the Tibetan Plateau.
2. Satellite remote sensing allows for the estimation of heat fluxes over large and diverse geographical areas, providing a regional perspective on energy and water cycles. 

3. Satellite sensors can capture data at high spatial resolutions, enabling the assessment of heat fluxes over heterogeneous landscapes with varying surface conditions. 

4.  Integration with Field Observations:  Satellite data can be combined with ground-based measurements to enhance the accuracy and reliability of heat flux estimations, providing a comprehensive understanding of surface-atmosphere interactions.

5. Overall, the use of satellite remote sensing for deriving heat fluxes offers a powerful and efficient approach to studying energy and water cycles over large and complex landscapes like the Tibetan Plateau.

1. ACP: The article discusses a study that combines MODIS, AVHRR, and in situ data to estimate evapotranspiration over the Tibetan Plateau. The study introduces a parameterization method using MODIS and AVHRR data, along with in situ data, to estimate the regional evaporative fraction over the Tibetan Plateau. The results were validated using ground truth measurements at Tibetan Observation and Research Platform and CAMP/Tibet meteorological stations. The estimated evaporative fraction values were found to be in good agreement with the ground truth measurements, with the absolute percentage difference being less than 10% at the validation sites.

2. JGR-A: The article discusses the estimation of regional land surface heat fluxes in the central Tibetan Plateau area using Landsat-7 ETM data and field observations. The study aims to upscale point or patch scale field observations to a regional distribution using high-resolution Landsat-7 ETM data. The methodology involves using remote sensing data to derive surface variables and heat fluxes, such as net radiation flux, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux. The findings indicate seasonal variations in surface heat and water fluxes, with higher evaporation in summer than in winter. The derived results from Landsat-7 ETM data are comparable to those from NOAA/AVHRR data, and the methodology shows good agreement with field measurements. The study has implications for understanding the energy and water cycle over the Tibetan Plateau and its impact on the global climate system.
